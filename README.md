## Linux Configurations
I'm just using this to be able to always remember a pretty consistent .vimrc and .tmux.conf and whatever else happens. I'll try to remember to put useful links here on my inspiration for why I did stuff.

* configs/.vimrc
  * https://dougblack.io/words/a-good-vimrc.html
  * https://github.com/amix/vimrc/blob/master/vimrcs/basic.vim
  * https://github.com/ajh17/VimCompletesMe
  * https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim
  * https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes
* configs/.tmux.conf
  * https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-guide-to-customizing-your-tmux-conf/
* configs/grub
  * options to add to boot to make things work
* src/headphone_fix
  * bluetooth trick to make headphones work with pc

Don't really know what more there is to come, but I guess we'll find out as we go as we add and modify the .vimrc and .tmux.conf!
